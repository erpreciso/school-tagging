					<p>The general paradigm behind a School-Tagging platform is illustrated in the diagram. There are two user entities: teachers and students. After a teacher logs in the platform, she can start a new session by choosing a unique string identifier. This token is communicated to the students in the classroom, who have to use it to access the session. As they do so, their names become visible on the teacher's interface. After all students have accessed the platform, the teacher can choose a single exercise instance (e.g., a sentence to annotate) which is sent to all the students. As the students answer, the teacher is able to monitor in real-time each single answer and all aggregated answers via an interactive chart. After all students have answered (or the teacher decides that the time is up), the teacher can optionally promote some discussion in the class (e.g., asking specific students to justify the chosen answer). Finally, she is asked to select the correct answer. This validation generates an immediate feedback to the students. All answers are permanently written in a centralised datastore, which allows to keep track of students and classrooms progress as well as makes the data available for research purposes.</p>
<h3>Grammar exercises</h3>
In the current prototype we have implemented 2 grammar game-exercises. 
<ol>
	<li>In the first one, the CHOOSE-WORD,  students are presented with a sentence and they have to select all entities (morphemes, single words or word sequences) that belong to a specific grammatical category.</li>
	<li>In the second exercise, the CHOOSE-CATEGORY, students have to provide syntactic information of a linguistic entity which is highlighted in a given sentence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two exercises are complementary to each other with respect to the type of annotation the students input into the system. The first exercise identifies how each sentence is segmented into linguistic units (entities), each being mapped to a coarse grammatical category. The second exercise, enables to ask students more fine grained syntactic information about highlighted entities (e.g. number for nouns, mode and tense for verbs).</p>
<p>Currently, the set of sentences from which exercises are generated is a pre-built corpus of few hundred sentences. In future versions of the platform, we are planning to allow teachers to input their own sentences or extract them automatically from the Internet.</p>
<h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
<p>The current project's implementation is based on the Google Application Engine (GAE) framework. GAE enabled us to quickly develop a web-based prototype, which was easily deployable on the Internet, while eliminating all efforts in maintaining a local server, and providing immediate integration of a cloud system for data hosting (the datastore). This technology allows full scalability up to an unrestricted number of users: with no extra effort, the platform could be potentially extended to an unrestricted number of schools across different countries, producing a significantly large volume of multilingual and cross-cultural annotated data. This could foster the creation of a network of students and teachers who could exchange not only their experience, but could provide suggestions for improving the system, while building an international community of expert users.</p>
<p>The backend is implemented in Python, which makes use of two main libraries: webapp2 (lightweight Python web framework compatible with Google App Engine) and jinja2 (full featured template engine for Python).</p>
<p>The frontend development is based on Javascript, and makes use of the HighCharts graphical library for displaying interactive charts on the teacher interface.</p>
<p>Two main interface templates are available, one for the teacher and one for the students. The Google Channel API is used as interaction framework to enable real-time communication between the students and the teacher. The interactions between the server and the javascript clients works by opening a unique channel using a token identifier.</p>
<p>Regarding the Data Storage, we are using the Google App Engine Datastore, which is built on top of the Bigtable distributed storage system with implementation of memcache to improve performance and avoid transactions latency issues and accessible via the NDB Python API, through which the datastore can be exported in JSON format.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>We have conducted a pilot study of the current platform in the computer-science lab of an Italian junior-high school equipped with 16 PCs. Two different classrooms (grade 6 and 9) participated in the test with a total number of 48 students, divided in 4 different groups. They have accessed the online platform using the Chrome browser installed in the local machines.</p>
<p>The students responded very positively to the novel methodology: in an anonymous questionnaire the overall majority has answered that they liked the system (88.5%), that the teacher's feedback was useful (77.1%) and that they would like to use the system regularitly in class (87.5%).</p>
<h3>Demo Planning</h3>
<p>In the demo session we would like to present the latest working version of the School-Tagging platform to the public, by simulating a classroom game-learning activity. We would use a large screen to show the teacher interface, and make a few devices available that are connected to the same session as students. Members of the audience can test the system in both roles of student or teacher using their own or provided devices.</p>
<p>The current version of the prototype can be tested at <a href="http://school-tagging.appspot.com">school-tagging.appspot.com</a>; in order to simulate multiple users on the same machine we recommend to open the webapp on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). Two sessions can run on the same browser only if one is set to ``private'' mode. A video demonstrating the platform is embedded in the same webpage.</p>
